# AAKA+
Python implementation of the 5G AKA protocol and the AAKA(Anonymous Authentication and Key Agreement) + BB(Boneh-Boyen signature)/PS(Pointcheval-Sanders Signature) schemes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8

## Setup

Before starting the simulations, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed.

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```shell
   pip install cryptography ecies bplib pytest
   ```

## Running on Different Platforms

These scripts are designed to run on both Linux and Windows systems. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed, and follow the instructions for running each script as described below.

## 5G AKA

### Overview

This section involves the 5G AKA protocol implementation with ECISE SUCI encryption. The Home Network (HN), Serving Network (SN), and Subscriber (Sub) interact to perform authentication.

### Detailed Instructions

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the 5G AKA simulation, see the [5G AKA README](https://github.com/XieMin-snnu/AAKA--BB-PS/blob/main/5G_AKA/README.md).

## AAKA+

### Overview

This section involves two different schemes:  AAKA+BB/PS schemes. Each scheme has its own implementation and corresponding tests.

### Detailed Instructions

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the AAKA+ simulations, see the [AAKA+ README](https://github.com/XieMin-snnu/AAKA--BB-PS/blob/main/AAKA%2B/README.md).
